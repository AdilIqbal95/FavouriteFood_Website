        <h2>Places to eat</h2>
        <h3>Poulet Chicken</h3>
        <p>Poulet Chicken is not your ordinary chicken place. They’re famous for their specialty items, such as ‘Carbonara Chicken’. The tender chicken pieces go incredibly well in their creamy carbonara sauce giving you a whole new Korean fried chicken experience. Poulet Chicken also offers their own craft beer ‘fresh cream draft beer’ that enhances the flavor of the chicken even more.</p>
        <h3>Sai Chicken</h3>
        <p>While it is a relatively new restaurant in Seoul, Sai Chicken has become one of the most popular fried chicken places in the city. If deliciously breaded chicken served in a relaxing atmosphere tickles your fancy, Sai Chicken is the place for you. Not only do they serve lip-smacking chicken here, but the fries are said to be among the best in Seoul as well.</p>
        <h3>Chicken in the Kitchen</h3>
        <p>This is one of those places you’ll find customers lining up in front of all week long. Chicken in the Kitchen makes all their meals, sides and sauces from scratch using fresh, local ingredients. You can order chicken plain fried or with sauce. The meals are served with onion rings, wedge potatoes, and Korean rice cakes. Due to the massive demand, Chicken in the Kitchen only serves 50 chickens a day.</p>
